## Integration
To include `celluloid/culture` and its many splendors to any `Celluloid` gem, add it as a GIT submodule of your project.

##### Add celluloid/culture as GIT submodule:
```sh
git submodule add http://github.com/celluloid/culture.git
```

Make sure `http://` is used and no other method of inclusion, as CI needs it to be `http://`

Once you've done that, read up on [Celluloid::Sync](SYNC.md) and [RuboCop](rubocop/README.md)
