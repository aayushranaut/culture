### Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

This year is pivotal. Celluloid is approaching "1.0" across its suite of Ruby gems. We need momentum, and students' attention focused on Celluloid itself. We worked in a broader "Ruby" organization. Now we need our own GSoC program for two main reasons:

1) We are critical to the most epic shift in software. With us, any coder can create parallel, asynchronous, concurrent, and/or distributed systems, simply. We hold & gain ground in a fierce, overly complex, multi-threaded multi-core space fought over by Erlang/Elixr, Go, Rust, Akka, etc.

2) We are critical to Ruby itself: a) We maintain libraries widely used by many Ruby gems, and have millions of downloads. b) We bring design diversity to Ruby. The vast majority of Rubyists tend toward one design approach: Rails+Rack. We offer alternatives sparing Ruby from monoculture. c) We cause Ruby itself to evolve. We utilize and stretch every aspect of every Ruby engine. Ruby needs the beating we provide for it to remain relevant in this era.
