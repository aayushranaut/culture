### How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

We will hold short but frequent mentor "stand-up" meetings every two weeks at the longest ( but aspiring to weekly ) for implementing the Agile and Scrum methodology's style of status and assistance meetings.

We will treat the group of mentors as a team, and treat the entire organization as a pool of talent and assistance for all the other students and mentors in the organization.

Rather than treat projects as a water-tight compartments, we will cross-motivate students: We will share successes. We will draw attention to unique dilemmas. We will encourage, showcase our students' progress during the program, and foster a spirit of respectful but heated competition.

As mentioned in "how will you keep mentors engaged with their students" we will have a non-mentor organization administrator acting as auditor, mentor assistant, and chief cheer-leader.
