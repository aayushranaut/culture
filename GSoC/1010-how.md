### How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

We have many contributors with profound management experience. One of our organization administrators will not be mentoring a student, and will be responsible for encouragement, and assessing all communication and activity areas on constant basis.

All mentors will be in Ryver ( an alternative to Slack ) and accessible 24x7. All students will also be present in Ryver, but locked within their own project. All student activity ( both code and communication ) will be visible, and organization administrators will be monitoring student activity and mentor interactions.

On a weekly basis, before a prolonged period of trouble or inactivity, at least one person in addition to the mentor involved will know a student began to fall behind their stated goals, and the organization's expectations.

Celluloid community will continue to use Hangouts, Google Groups, IRC, Twitter, and GitHub, to keep contact beyond Ryver. Celluloid is a tight community who respond to and encourage each other.
